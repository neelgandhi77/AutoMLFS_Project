# AutoMLFS_Project
<br>
Automated Machine Learning provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning.
<br>
Machine learning (ML) has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human machine learning experts to perform the following tasks:
<br>
Preprocess and clean the data.
Select and construct appropriate features.
Select an appropriate model family.
Optimize model hyperparameters.
Design the topology of neural networks (if deep learning is used).
Postprocess machine learning models.
Critically analyze the results obtained.
As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-ML-experts, the rapid growth of machine learning applications has created a demand for off-the-shelf machine learning methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. We call the resulting research area that targets progressive automation of machine learning AutoML.
